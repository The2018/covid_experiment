# Covid Data Experiment

This project is dedicated to the application of machine learning algorithms and tools to analysis of covid pandemic. We try to find out the correlation and association between the containment of pandemics and the cultural values for each country, which are collected from the World Value Surveys.

Before we apply any algorithms to the data, we need to preprocess covid data and cultural data and combine both datasets. It's also necessary to do a exploratory data anaylsis on the data, for example, the correlation matrix visualized by heatmap, to see if there exists any relationship between containment of covid pandemics and cultural values.

For this experiment, we use two datasets below: 

The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases and Deaths dataset is provided by World Health Organization and updated daily. It contains the historical record of covid cases and deaths for each country. The visualization, downloadable dataset and meta data information can be found [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/coronavirus-covid-19-cases-and-deaths)

The cultural dataset collected from World Value Survey for people of different countries, and processed by the previous experiment can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZqj4cQpq1BJAnXOIXzgXoCVmmR20Rcm/view?usp=sharing). For demonstration purposes, we only use the representative countries selected [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yOFofd2kWRAhTduM3jKZifw91Dm6g1T5HO2i4xR-agA/edit?usp=sharing)
